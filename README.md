# Minimalish-Nvim

A Neovim config built on `vim.pack`. No plugin manager, no bootstrap script.

Needs Neovim 0.13-dev.

## Dependencies

```sh
paru -S --needed git fzf ripgrep tree-sitter-cli zoxide wl-clipboard \
  lua-language-server bash-language-server pyright ruff \
  typescript-language-server stylua shfmt prettier
```

A Nerd Font is needed for icons. `zoxide` and `wl-clipboard` are optional.

Language servers for the rest of the enabled languages. Skip any you don't
use; a missing server just never attaches.

```sh
paru -S --needed gopls clang rust-analyzer jdk-openjdk jdtls csharp-ls \
  vscode-json-languageserver vscode-html-languageserver \
  vscode-css-languageserver yaml-language-server marksman taplo-cli
```

## Language servers

Native `vim.lsp`, no nvim-lspconfig or Mason. Each server has a config in
`lsp/<name>.lua` and is turned on in `lua/lsp.lua`. Servers come from the
system package manager.

| Language              | Server                |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Lua                   | lua_ls                |
| Bash                  | bashls                |
| Python                | pyright + ruff        |
| JS / TS               | ts_ls                 |
| Go                    | gopls                 |
| C / C++               | clangd                |
| Rust                  | rust_analyzer         |
| Java                  | jdtls                 |
| C#                    | csharp_ls             |
| JSON / YAML / TOML    | jsonls, yamlls, taplo |
| HTML / CSS / Markdown | html, cssls, marksman |

clangd needs a `compile_commands.json` (CMake:
`-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON`) or `compile_flags.txt` in the project.
jdtls keeps a per-project index under `~/.cache/nvim/jdtls/`.

To add a language: install the server, add `lsp/<name>.lua` with `cmd`,
`filetypes` and `root_markers`, then add `<name>` to `vim.lsp.enable` in
`lua/lsp.lua`. Check it with `:checkhealth vim.lsp`.

## Install

Back up an existing config first:

```sh
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv ~/.local/state/nvim ~/.local/state/nvim.bak
```

Then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JuicyGoose007-coder/minimalish-nvim ~/.config/nvim
nvim
```

First launch clones the plugins and builds treesitter parsers. Restart after.

| Key                                        |                                                             |

Completion is blink.cmp on the `default` preset: `<C-n>`/`<C-p>` move, `<C-y>`
accepts, `<C-e>` takes the ghost text, `<C-g>` cancels. `<Tab>`/`<S-Tab>` are
left to tabout.nvim for jumping out of brackets and quotes.

`<C-h/j/k/l>` are used by vim-tmux-navigator for pane switching, which takes
`<C-l>` from Nvim's multicursor clear; `<Esc>` does it instead.

In the file explorer, `l` opens a file and closes the explorer; `L` opens it
and keeps the explorer up.

Some builtins are tweaked: `n` `N` `<C-d>` `<C-u>` recenter, `J` keeps the
cursor in place, and a bare `j`/`k` moves by wrapped line.
